Tetsing new methods of creating a drive train base for FRC robots. This project will attemp to create
multiple drive bases for some forms of drivetrains and build them in a readable and useable matter.

All code is done in a command base WPIlib format.

The drivetraisn are coded to be driven using a joystick.

# Current Drive Train Systems Supported:
   - ArcadeDrive (In development)
   
# Drive Train Systems Yet to be Completed:
   - Quad Mecanum
   - Octo Omniwheel?
   - H Drive?
   
# Using this code?
Download individual drivetrain file of the type of drivetrain you wish to use. Instructions for
